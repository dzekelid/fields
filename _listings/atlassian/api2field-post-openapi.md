        Returns all issue fields in Jira, both system and custom fields.

        **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the following rules apply:

        *   Fields that cannot be added to the issue navigator are always returned.
        *   Fields that cannot be placed on an issue screen are always returned.
        *   Fields that depend on global Jira settings are only returned if the setting is enabled. That is, timetracking fields, subtasks, votes, and watches.
        *   For all other fields, this method only returns the fields that the current user has permission to see (that is, the field can be used in at least one project that the user can see).

        Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

        ### About notification schemes

        A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

        *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
        *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

        *   `CurrentAssignee`
        *   `Reporter`
        *   `CurrentUser`
        *   `ProjectLead`
        *   `ComponentLead`
        *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
        *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
        *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
        *   `EmailAddress`
        *   `AllWatchers`
        *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
        *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

        _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

        **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

        ### About permission schemes and grants

        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

        #### Holder

        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

        *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
        *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

        *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
        *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
        *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
        *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
        *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
        *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
        *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
        *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
        *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
        *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
        *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

        #### Permissions

        The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.
